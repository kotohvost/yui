#
#    color   |  number
#    --------|-------     -----------|-------
#    black   |  0         hi_black   |  8
#    red     |  1         hi_red     |  9

# Sample:
# Change background fron blue (default) to red: in colormap_bg instead of
# 01234567 placing 04231567 (side effect - instead red we receive blue :-) )
#
# When your color order is different from default, you should setup your
# properly order manually.
