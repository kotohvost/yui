10.08.08        Released version 3.2.04, which contains unbreak build for 64-bit
CityCat		archs. Patch was made and provided by Alexey Rusanov. Also some
3.2.04		changes in configure.in - now I pass arch as variable. Also added
		file THANKS, which listed some special thanks and people, which
                these thanks were received.

24.07.07        Released version 3.2.03, which contains some bugfixes to avoid
CityCat		build break on -CURRENT. Also some warnings were eliminated.
3.2.03		Also, instead of tmpnam() we now use mkstemp() to make temp
		file to file saving.

18.01.07        I have compeltely rewrote man page y.1 and added files BUGS
CityCat		with discovered bugs list and TODO with supposed future works

03.03.06	So, king was dead, long live the king! This day I take control on
CityCat		this really great program, which I have use for ages and now this
3.2.1		file I have edited with it. But since 2000 was flowed so many
                water... At least I'd like to migrate this building under autotools
                build factory and throw out a web-client. I think, console-based
                web-clients is a: links, lynx, and so on...
