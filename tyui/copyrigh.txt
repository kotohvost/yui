  	Console text editor "Yui - next generation (yui NG)" is a opensource
  project, distributed under BSD license. Their code is based on "Yui" editor,
  which was developed in 1994-2000 years in Engineering-Technical Company
  (http://www.itk.ru).
  	Since 2000 year ITK was stopped their developing, but because editor
  itself was a brilliant software for each programmer, I decide to revise
  code and start "yui NG" project. As respect for their main developer,
  Sergey Rozenfeld, I have kept binary name - "yui NG" still have a binary
  with "y" name.

  	Original Yui software was a multiplatform. Because I haven't access to
  various UNIX distribution, "yui NG" will primarly developed and tested under
  FreeBSD. It means, that some new features will tested (by me) only under
  FreeBSD.
